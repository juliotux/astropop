The ASTROnomical POlarimetry and Photometry pipeline. Developed for work with IAGPOL and SPARC4 polarimeters at Observat√≥rio Pico dos Dias (Brazil), but suitable to be used in other image polarimeters around the world.

Features
^^^^^^^^

This software is intended to provide a full pipeline to reduce raw polarimetry and photometry data taken with common CCD telescope cameras. It can do:

- Create calibrate frames;

- Calibrate images using bias/flat/dark frames;

- Gain correction and in-processing image binnig;

- Cosmic ray extraction (astroscrappy);

- Align image sets;

- Aperture and (planned) PSF photometry;

- Calcite polarimeters;

  - Automatic pairs of stars identification;

- Automatic photometry calibration using online catalogs.

Support and Community
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have a community of people using astropop to perform data reduction. Also, we use this community to offer support for astropop users. Join the community at `astropop-users Google-Groups <https://groups.google.com/g/astropop-users>`_

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of astropop dependencies (numpy, astropy, scipy, astroscrappy) need gcc to get build. Make sure gcc is installed properly in your system.

There is nothing that prevent astropop itself to run on Windows. However, due to problems that comes from dependencies, mainly numpy and astrometry.net, astropop is currently supported only on Linux and Mac.

Bellow we list all the necessary dependencies for the good working of the code. Note that this can be changed with the time.

- astroalign;

- astropy >= 4.3;

- astroquery;

- astroscrappy;

- numpy >= 1.17;

- scikit-image;

- scikit-learn;

- scipy;

- sep.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Astropop can be downloaded from `gh/sparc4-dev/astropop <https://github.com/sparc4-dev/astropop>`_. It follows the stadard python package install procedure. All requirements can be installed with `pip` or `conda`.

Anaconda Environment
--------------------

We recomend to use a `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ environment to use astropop. Having the anaconda installed, use the following command to install a new `<environment name>` with conda dependencies:

.. code-block::

    conda create -n <environment name> -c conda-forge python=3.10 astroalign astropy astroquery astroscrappy matplotlib numpy pyyaml reproject scikit-image scikit-learn scipy sep

Once the environment is created, you can `activate the environment <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment>`_ and install the astropop with `pip`.

.. code-block::

   conda activate <environment name>

Stable Version
--------------

The stable version of astropop is available in `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_ and can be installed directly with `pip` command.

.. code-block::

   pip install astropop

Development Version
-------------------

The development (unstable) version can be installed from the github code. With `pip`, can be done in any of the 3 ways:

.. code-block::

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/sparc4-dev/astropop

or

.. code-block::

   pip install -U https://github.com/sparc4-dev/astropop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

or

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/sparc4-dev/astropop
   cd astropop
   pip install -U .
