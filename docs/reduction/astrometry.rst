Astrometry Calibration
======================

Performing astrometric calibration is simple in |astropop|. It uses as backend the `astrometry.net`_ program.

In summary, `astrometry.net`_ searches a given field in the sky and computes a `World Coordinate System <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html>`_ astrometric solution that can be used to relate a image coorditate ``(x, y)`` to physical sky coordinates, like ``(ra, dec)``.

For a more detailed WCS usage, see |astropy| documentation of |WCS|.

About astrometry.net
--------------------

From `astrometry.net`_ readme: Automatic recognition of astronomical images; or standards-compliant astrometric metadata from data.

So, `astrometry.net`_ creates robust |WCS| calibrations with almost none or no information about the field. It searches the solution around the sky using `index files <http://astrometry.net/doc/readme.html#getting-index-files>`_ and find optimal solutions using a very smart and fast algorithm based on 4-stars asterisms. Detailed explanation of `astrometry.net`_ is given in `Lang et al. (2010) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....139.1782L/abstract>`_ atricle.

This code can be very fast if enough information about the field is needed. But, slowly, it can find the solution completely blind. It also can run locally in a common laptop. However, to run locally it needs the index files that, some times, can use a large disk space.

An online service is also available at `nova.astrometry.net <https://nova.astrometry.net>`_ and can be accessed by python using `astroquery.astrometry_net <https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astrometry_net/astrometry_net.html>`_ interface. This is recomended for who don't want to download the index files.

Installing astrometry.net
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`astrometry.net`_ is a C written language that runs in command line. Currently, it only is supported on Linux and Mac. Windows is not supported by the developers. Due to this, its install is a bit tricky and, for most users, it may envolve building from the code. Detailed instructions about building and installing from the code or Linux distribution-specific installs can be found in `astrometry.net installing read-me <http://astrometry.net/doc/build.html#build>`_.

For `Anaconda <https://anaconda.com>`_ users, the project `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_, that is a collection of community maintaned packages, provide a simplier way to install `astrometry.net`_ inside conda environments. You just need to:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge astrometry

or, withing a specific separated environment, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -n <environment_name> -c conda-forge astrometry

Index files
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several sets of pre-built index files that can be used to run `astrometry.net`_. They are listed in `<http://data.astrometry.net/>`_. For more informations about how to download it, see `astrometry.net indexes read-me <http://astrometry.net/doc/readme.html#getting-index-files>`_.

If you want to download the index files and do not change anything to get it running, the files must be put in ``$INSTALL_DIR/data`` folder. If you download it to another location, you must change the ``$INSTALL_DIR/etc/astrometry.cfg``, adding the ``add_path <location of the indexes>`` line. `astrometry.net`_ will search all the folders listed in the configuration to seek index files.

In |astropop|, there is also an option in all the functions that compute astrometric solutions where you can set the index locations. See individual functions for more information.

Astropop wrapper usage
----------------------

|astropop| do not implement the solution by itself, it just wraps around the `astrometry.net`_ command-line code.

There is two ways to run the `astrometry.net`_ code inside |astropop|. Using a class-like interface and specific helper funcions. |astropop| will take care of prepare the inputs, monitor the process (with realtime logging output), read the outputs and organize them in a structure useful in Python. So you don't need to manually read the solution and deal with a ton of files produced by `astrometry.net`_.

All of them run the code in a similar way, giving the result in the same format.

Solution Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `astrometry.net`_ outputs several files, including plots, but, considering the astrometric solution itself, just a few of them are really useful. So, we decided to store this solution in a |AstrometricSolution| container. It contains:

- wcs: the |WCS| solved instance, created from the solved header.
- header: the FITS |Header| generated by `astrometry.net`_ containing the solution.
- correspondences: a |Table| containing the correspondences between stars seen in the field and the index file used to solve the astrometry by `astrometry.net`_.

To manually build an |AstrometricSolution| container, you just need to pass the solved header and, optionally, the correspondences table.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropop.astrometry import AstrometricSolution
    >>> from astropy.utils.data import get_pkg_data_filename
    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> fn = get_pkg_data_filename('data/j94f05bgq_flt.fits', package='astropy.wcs.tests')
    >>> header = fits.open(fn)[1].header
    >>> # Correspondeces is optional
    >>> solution = AstrometricSolution(header)
    >>> print(solution.wcs)

Class-like interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |solve_field| replace:: `~astropop.astrometry.AstrometrySolver.solve_field`

The most general wrapper interface implemented is trough a class-like object. The |AstrometrySolver| class can be used to run the ``solve-field`` `astrometry.net`_ interface and return the results in a very pythonic way.

Its job is to organize the inputs, options and configuration files, prepare and execute the ``solve-field`` command, check for solution and return a |AstrometricSolution| object if there is a solution.

To run the command, you must create a instance of |AstrometrySolver| and execute it using |solve_field| method. The |solve_field| method has, as main input, a ``filename`` that can be solved by ``solve-field`` `astrometry.net`_ command. There are several types accepted, like FITS files, common images (like .png, .jpg), and XYLS tables. For more information see the `astrometry.net solving documentation <http://astrometry.net/doc/readme.html#solving>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # get the sample image
    >>> from astroquery.skyview import SkyView
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import Angle
    >>> filename = 'M20_test_file.fits'
    >>> s = SkyView.get_images('M20', radius=Angle('60 arcmin'), pixels=2048, survey='DSS')
    >>> s[0][0].writeto(filename)
    >>>
    >>> # Run the solution
    >>> from astropop.astrometry import AstrometrySolver
    >>> solver = AstrometrySolver()
    >>> solution = solver.solve_field(filename, options={'radius': 5.0})
    >>>
    >>> print(solution.wcs)

Using keyword arguments to be passed to |run_command| you can store ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` of ``solve-field`` in lists. Check the API from more details. Also, setting ``stdout_loglevel`` and ``stderr_loglevel`` you can print the live output of the code using `~logging` system.

Also, you can pass any parameter of ``astrometry.cfg`` file to the options. These parameters will be organized and a custom configuration file will be created, enabling these options only for that run. Manual edition of the config is also available using `~astropop.astrometry.AstrometrySolver.config` dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> solver = AstrometrySolver(config={'index': 'index-401.fits', 'add_path': ['/data1', '/data2']})
    >>> solver.config['inparallel'] = False
    >>> solution = solver.solve_field(filename, options={'add_path': '/home/user/gaia-indexes', 'autoindex': True})

Additional Python inputs, like |ImageHDU|, |FrameData|, and ``(x, y, flux)`` arrays are supported trough hepler functions, described in the section bellow.

Type-specific helper functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Helper functions to handle some common Python formats are provided to make easy solving the fields directly from these objects, without manual save of files.

The helpers are:

- `~astropop.astrometry.solve_astrometry_xy`: for solving lists of sources with image coordinates and fluxes extracted outside `astrometry.net`_.
- `~astropop.astrometry.solve_astrometry_framedata`: for solving |FrameData| objects.
- `~astropop.astrometry.solve_astrometry_image`: image file saved on disk.
- `~astropop.astrometry.solve_astrometry_hdu`: for solving |ImageHDU| objects.

Each function has its own specific arguments, but all of them have the same optional arguments. They are:

- ``command``: used to set the ``solve-field`` CLI path.
- ``options``: custom options used in the run.
- Any ``**kwargs`` keyword argument: passed to |run_command| function, like ``stdout``, ``stderr`` and log levels.

Supported ``solve-field`` options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |astropop| `astrometry.net`_ wrapper don't support all `solve-field` command-line interface options.

Also, we added the possibility to add any ``astrometry.cfg`` configuration file parameter to options. These configuration parameters will be read and popped out from options, a new config file will be created and used just for that run.

The supported options can be print in the screen using `~astropop.astrometry.AstrometrySolver.print_options_help` or `~astropop.astrometry.astrometrynet.get_options_help` funtions. They are described bellow.
